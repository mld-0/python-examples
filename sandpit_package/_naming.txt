#	TODO: 2022-06-24T00:06:58AEST python-examples/sandpit_package, _naming, <how/where> to <search/list> names to to use (already taken) for a package (presumedly, those build-in and installable through pip?)

PEP8:
Modules (python files) 
	Should have short, all-lower names. Use underscores to improve readability.

Packages (directory containing '__init__.py') 
	Should have short, all-lower names. Underscores are allowed, but discouraged.
